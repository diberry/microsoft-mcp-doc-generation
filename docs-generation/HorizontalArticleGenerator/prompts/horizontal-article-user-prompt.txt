Generate JSON data for a how-to article about managing {{serviceBrandName}} with Azure MCP Server.

## Input Data Provided

**Service Information:**
- Service Brand Name: {{serviceBrandName}}
- Service Identifier: {{serviceIdentifier}}
- Tools Reference Link: {{toolsReferenceLink}}

**Available MCP Tools for this service:**
{{#each tools}}
Tool: {{command}}
Description: {{description}}
Parameters: {{parameterCount}} parameters
Characteristics:
  - Destructive: {{metadata.destructive.value}}
  - Read-only: {{metadata.readOnly.value}}
  - Requires secrets: {{metadata.secret.value}}
{{/each}}

## Your Task

**FIRST**: Analyze the tools to determine data plane vs management plane focus:
- Review each tool's command and description
- **Data plane tools**: Work with data/functionality in existing resources (get, set, query, upload, execute, read, write)
- **Management plane tools**: Manage resource lifecycle (create, delete, update, provision, configure resources)
- **Default assumption**: If unclear, assume **data plane** unless tool explicitly manages resource lifecycle
- Determine the service's primary focus based on the majority of tools

**SECOND**: Search for published Azure documentation about {{serviceBrandName}}. Find:
- Official service overview/description
- Prerequisites and setup requirements
- RBAC roles and permissions (data plane vs management plane roles)
- Best practices and security recommendations
- Common use cases and scenarios

**THEN**: Generate a JSON object following the system prompt schema. Focus on:

1. **Service Understanding**: Based on **official Azure documentation** and the tool commands/descriptions, determine:
   - A noun phrase describing what users manage (genai-serviceShortDescription). MUST NOT end with a period. Must read naturally after "Manage" — e.g., "keys, secrets, and certificates" or "web applications and database connections"
   - A 2-3 sentence service description starting with "is a..." or "provides..." (genai-serviceOverview)
   - Capabilities derived directly from the tool descriptions above (genai-capabilities). Each capability must be a rephrasing of one tool's description into an action phrase. 1 tool = 1 capability. Do NOT add capabilities beyond the provided tools
   - **Primary plane focus**: Data plane (default) or management plane

2. **Tool Summaries**: For each tool, create a concise 10-15 word description (genai-shortDescription)

3. **Get Started Scenarios**: Create 3-5 scenarios. The **first example from each scenario** appears in the article's "Get started" section, so:
   - Make each scenario's first example the most representative and specific prompt
   - **Every scenario must map to a specific tool command from the input** — do NOT suggest operations that no provided tool supports (e.g., don't suggest "update" if only an "add" tool exists)
   - If only 1 tool exists, create 2-3 scenarios that all use that same tool with different parameters/contexts
   - Cover different tools across scenarios for diversity (when multiple tools exist)
   - Use natural conversational phrasing with real resource names, regions, and configurations
   - **Use service-specific terminology** (e.g., actual feature names, SKU values, configuration options)
   - **For data plane**: Assume resources exist. Example: "Get secret 'db-password' from key vault 'prod-secrets'"
   - **For management plane**: Focus on provisioning. Example: "Create a new key vault named 'prod-secrets' in East US"

4. **Permissions**: Look up official Azure RBAC built-in roles ONLY from https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles. Search that page for the service name. Every role you output must be verifiable on that page. If unsure, use fallback defaults from system prompt (e.g., "Cognitive Services Contributor" for AI services, "Contributor" for general resources)

5. **Best Practices**: 3-5 practices covering security, reliability, cost, and performance. Every best practice must satisfy TWO grounding requirements: (1) it must relate to operations the available tools support, and (2) it should be supported by official Azure documentation for this service. No trailing periods on titles. Do NOT recommend general service features (scaling, monitoring, backup) unless a tool exists for those operations.

6. **Resources**: Provide documentation links with `/azure/...` paths (remove `https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us` prefix). Use `/azure/ai-services/` instead of retired `/azure/cognitive-services/`. **If you are not confident a URL path is correct, leave the `url` field as an empty string** — an empty link is better than a fabricated 404 link.

## Key Constraints

- **Universality**: This prompt runs for ALL 52 Azure MCP namespaces. Every field you generate must be grounded to the specific tools and service provided above — do not assume any particular Azure service. Apply all rules generically regardless of service
- **Authentication**: Azure MCP Server uses `DefaultAzureCredential` (Microsoft Entra ID). Do not mention API keys anywhere
- **Naming**: Use "Microsoft Entra ID" instead of "Azure Active Directory" (renamed in 2023)
- **Tool grounding**: Capabilities, scenarios, and example prompts must ONLY reference operations the provided MCP tools support. Do NOT invent additional features
- **Prerequisites**: Do NOT include "Azure subscription" as a service-specific prerequisite — it is already in the template
- **Tool links**: Do not generate `moreInfoLink` values — pre-computed by build system
- **Omit**: Do NOT generate `genai-aiSpecificScenarios`, `genai-authenticationNotes`, or `genai-commonIssues` fields
- **No trailing periods**: genai-serviceShortDescription, capability strings, best practice titles, prerequisite titles, and scenario titles must NEVER end with a period. A trailing period on genai-serviceShortDescription breaks 3 template locations.

## Output Format

Return ONLY valid JSON - no markdown code blocks, no explanations, just the JSON object as defined in the system prompt.
