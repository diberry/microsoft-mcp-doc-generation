Generate JSON data for a how-to article about using Azure MCP Server with {{serviceBrandName}}.

## Input Data Provided

**Service Information:**
- Service Brand Name: {{serviceBrandName}}
- Service Identifier: {{serviceIdentifier}}
- Tools Reference Link: {{toolsReferenceLink}}

**Available MCP Tools for this service:**
{{#each tools}}
Tool: {{command}}
Description: {{description}}
Parameters: {{parameterCount}} parameters
Characteristics:
  - Destructive: {{metadata.destructive.value}}
  - Read-only: {{metadata.readOnly.value}}
  - Requires secrets: {{metadata.secret.value}}
{{/each}}

## Your Task

**FIRST**: Search for published Azure documentation about {{serviceBrandName}}. Find:
- Official service overview/description
- Prerequisites and setup requirements
- RBAC roles and permissions
- Best practices and security recommendations
- Common use cases and scenarios

**THEN**: Analyze the tool descriptions above and generate a JSON object following the structure defined in the system prompt. Focus on:

1. **Service Understanding**: Based on **official Azure documentation** and the tool commands/descriptions, determine:
   - What this Azure service does (serviceShortDescription)
   - Its main value proposition (serviceOverview)
   - Core capabilities accessible through MCP (capabilities)

2. **Tool Summaries**: For each tool, create a concise 10-15 word description (genai-shortDescription) that captures its purpose without technical jargon

3. **Realistic Scenarios**: Create 3-5 practical scenarios based on common workflows with these tools. Each scenario needs:
   - A clear title indicating the user's goal (business-focused)
   - Context about when/why someone would do this (real-world motivation)
   - 3-5 natural language commands a user could say to an AI assistant
     - **Important**: Phrase as natural conversation: "Create a storage account named 'myapp-data' in East US" not "storage account create myapp-data eastus"
     - Include specific values: resource names, regions, SKUs, configurations
     - Vary from simple to complex commands
   - The expected result they'll see (user-facing outcome, not internal state)

4. **AI Service Detection**: Determine if this is an AI-related service (contains keywords: AI, Foundry, OpenAI, Speech, Search with AI features, etc.). If yes, create AI-specific scenarios

5. **Permissions**: Search Azure documentation for the service's access control/RBAC page. Based on tool characteristics (destructive, read-only) and official documentation, determine appropriate Azure RBAC roles needed

6. **Best Practices**: Search Azure documentation for the service's best practices guide. Adapt official Azure recommendations to the MCP/AI assistant context:
   - **Prioritize**: Security, reliability, cost optimization, operational excellence, performance
   - **MCP-specific**: How to phrase commands for safety, when to confirm destructive operations, resource naming for clarity
   - **Azure Well-Architected**: Align with the 5 pillars when relevant to natural language interaction

7. **Resources**: Search for and provide:
   - genai-serviceDocLink: URL to the official "What is {{serviceBrandName}}?" or service overview page
   - genai-additionalLinks: URLs to quickstarts, tutorials, security best practices, pricing information

## Output Format

Return ONLY valid JSON - no markdown code blocks, no explanations, just the JSON object as defined in the system prompt.
