## Content Generation Guidelines

**IMPORTANT**: Search for and use published Azure documentation as your primary authoritative source. The input tool descriptions provide MCP-specific context, but you should validate service information, best practices, prerequisites, and RBAC roles against official Azure documentation.

**CRITICAL - Service Naming Consistency**:
- **ALWAYS use the official Azure service name** consistently throughout the article
- Find the official name from the service's documentation homepage (e.g., "Azure AI Search", "Azure Cosmos DB", "Azure Key Vault")
- Do NOT use shortened names ("Search", "Cosmos", "Key Vault") in the Overview or tool descriptions
- Exception: The service identifier (e.g., "search") is used only in file paths and IDs
- Validate: No sentence should start with a repeated word (e.g., "Search Azure Search" is invalid)

**CRITICAL - Data Plane vs Management Plane Analysis**:
Before generating content, carefully analyze each tool to determine if it operates on the **data plane** or **management plane**:

- **Management Plane Operations**: Create, delete, or configure Azure resources themselves (e.g., "create storage account", "delete key vault", "update database configuration"). These are ARM (Azure Resource Manager) operations that manage the resource lifecycle.

- **Data Plane Operations**: Work with data or functionality within existing resources (e.g., "upload blob to storage", "get secret from key vault", "query database", "execute function"). These operations assume the resource already exists and interact with its data or services.

**Default Assumption**: If the tool's purpose is ambiguous, **assume it is a data plane operation** unless the tool name explicitly includes resource lifecycle verbs like "create", "delete", "provision", or clearly manages resource configuration.

**Impact on Article Content**:
- For **data plane focused services**: Emphasize working with existing resources, data operations, and assume resources are already provisioned. Prerequisites should include "existing [resource] already created".
- For **management plane focused services**: Focus on resource lifecycle management, provisioning, and configuration.
- For **mixed services**: Clearly distinguish between management operations (provisioning) and data operations (using the service) in scenarios and capabilities.

1. **serviceShortDescription**: Search Azure documentation for the official service description. Extract the core purpose. Keep it concise and service-focused: "storage accounts for data persistence", "AI model deployment and management", "relational database services"
   - **Use descriptive capabilities**, not the service name itself (e.g., "full-text search capabilities" not "search service")
   - Keep under 10 words
   - Focus on WHAT it does, not WHAT it's called
   - **Reflect plane focus**: For data plane services, emphasize what data/operations users work with. For management plane, emphasize resource provisioning.

2. **serviceOverview**: Search Azure documentation for the service overview page. Write 2-3 sentences that:
   - **CRITICAL**: Do NOT start with the service brand name (template will add it automatically). Start directly with "is a..." or "provides..."
   - Example: For "Azure AI Search", write "is a cloud search service..." not "Azure AI Search is a cloud search service..."
   - Explain the primary problem it solves
   - Describe key capabilities and benefits
   - **Quality checks**:
     - First word must be a verb ("is", "provides", "offers", "enables") - NOT a noun or service name
     - Each sentence should provide NEW information (no repetitive phrases)
     - Use active voice and specific terminology
   - **For data plane services**: Emphasize working with existing resources and data operations
   - **For management plane services**: Focus on resource lifecycle and configuration management

3. **capabilities**: Transform tool descriptions into user-facing capability statements based on official Azure documentation. 
   - Start with action verbs: "Create and configure", "Monitor and diagnose", "Deploy and scale"
   - Focus on business outcomes, not technical implementation
   - Group related operations logically
   - **Align with plane**: Data plane capabilities focus on "Access", "Query", "Store", "Retrieve", "Execute". Management plane focuses on "Create", "Configure", "Delete", "Manage"

4. **serviceSpecificPrerequisites**: Only list prerequisites that are truly service-specific and required. 
   - Don't repeat generic Azure requirements (those are in the template)
   - Examples: "Existing Azure OpenAI resource", "Approved access to GPT-4", "Virtual network configured"
   - Each prerequisite should explain WHY it's needed, not just WHAT it is
   - **For data plane services**: Include "Existing [resource] already provisioned" as a prerequisite since data plane assumes resources exist
   - **For management plane services**: Focus on subscription access and permissions to create resources

5. **tools.genai-shortDescription**: Condense the full tool description to its essential action and target. Remove technical details but keep the core purpose
   - **Target length**: 8-12 words (max 15 words)
   - **Be specific**: Include what data/details are retrieved, not just "get details"
   - **Examples of GOOD descriptions**:
     - "Retrieve index schema, field definitions, and scoring profiles" (not "Get details of indexes")
     - "Execute full-text search with filters, facets, and scoring" (not "Query indexes for data")
     - "List blob containers with metadata and access tier info" (not "List containers")
   - **Examples of BAD descriptions** (too generic):
     - "Get information about resources" ❌
     - "Manage service settings" ❌
     - "Perform operations on data" ❌

6. **scenarios**: Create 3-5 realistic use cases based on tool capabilities. Each scenario should:
   - Have a clear business/operational goal that resonates with Azure users
   - Include 3-5 natural language example commands users would actually say to an AI assistant
   - **Natural language guidelines**: 
     - Use conversational phrasing: "Create a storage account named..." not "storage account create"
     - Include context: "Create a new storage account called 'mystorageacct' in the East US region"
     - Be specific: Include actual resource names, locations, and configuration values
     - Vary complexity: Mix simple requests with more detailed multi-parameter commands
   - Describe the expected outcome in user-friendly terms (what appears in portal/CLI, not technical internals)
   - **For data plane scenarios**: Assume resources already exist. Examples: "Get the secret 'api-key' from my key vault 'prod-kv'", "Upload file 'data.csv' to container 'imports'"
   - **For management plane scenarios**: Focus on provisioning and configuration. Examples: "Create a new storage account in East US", "Configure the database with 100 DTUs"

7. **aiSpecificScenarios**: Only populate if the service is AI-related. **AI Service Detection Rules**:
   - **Service name contains**: "AI", "Foundry", "OpenAI", "Cognitive", "Speech", "Vision", "Language"
   - **Tool descriptions contain AI keywords**: "knowledge base", "embeddings", "semantic", "vector", "retrieval", "inference", "model", "completion"
   - **If ANY of above match**: Generate 2-3 AI-specific scenarios showing AI capabilities (semantic search, RAG patterns, model deployment, etc.)
   - Search for AI-specific documentation to understand model interaction, training, deployment scenarios
   - Example scenarios: "Use semantic search with embeddings", "Implement RAG pattern with knowledge bases", "Deploy and query AI models"

8. **requiredRoles**: Search Azure documentation for the service's RBAC roles page. Use officially documented role names based on the tool operations (create/read/update/delete). Common examples: "Contributor", "Reader", "Owner", or service-specific roles
   - **⚠️ CRITICAL - ROLE NAME FORMAT RULES**:
     - Azure data plane roles follow pattern: "[Service] [Resource Type] Data [Action]"
       - Examples: "Storage Blob Data Reader", "Key Vault Secrets User", "Search Index Data Reader"
     - Azure management roles follow pattern: "[Service] [Resource Type] Contributor"
       - Examples: "Storage Account Contributor", "Key Vault Contributor", "Search Service Contributor"
     - ❌ NEVER use invented patterns like "[Service] [Feature] Data Reader" (e.g., "Search Knowledge Base Data Reader", "Storage Container Data Reader")
     - ❌ WRONG examples (will BLOCK generation): "Search Knowledge Base Data Reader", "Cosmos Index Data Reader", "Storage File Share Data Operator"
     - ✅ CORRECT fallback if unsure: Use generic "[Service] Service Contributor" or "[Service] Index Data Reader"
     - ✅ For Search specifically: Use ONLY "Search Index Data Reader", "Search Service Contributor" (Knowledge bases are part of Index operations, NOT separate roles)
   - **WHERE TO FIND OFFICIAL ROLES**:
     - **AUTHORITATIVE SOURCE**: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles
     - Search that page for "[Service Name]" to find all official roles
     - Azure Portal → [Service] → Access control (IAM) → Roles (for service-specific roles)
   - **VALIDATION RULES**: 
     - If a role name contains "Knowledge Base Data", "Feature Data", "Resource Data", "KB", or similar non-standard patterns: ❌ DO NOT USE (it's invented)
     - When in doubt: Consult the official Microsoft Learn RBAC roles page above
     - If you cannot find a role on the official page: Use the generic service-level role instead (e.g., "Search Service Contributor")
     - GENERATION WILL BE BLOCKED if invented roles are detected - this is a critical error
   - **For data plane services**: Prioritize data plane roles (e.g., "Storage Blob Data Contributor", "Key Vault Secrets User", "Cosmos DB Data Reader", "Search Index Data Reader")
   - **For management plane services**: Prioritize resource management roles (e.g., "Storage Account Contributor", "Key Vault Contributor", "Cosmos DB Account Contributor")
   - **Match the tool operations**: If tools are primarily data-focused, don't suggest management roles unless explicitly needed
   - **Minimum requirement**: Suggest at least 2 roles (one read-only, one contributor/admin) based on tool capabilities

9. **bestPractices**: Search Azure documentation for the service's best practices, security recommendations, and performance guidance. Adapt these to the MCP/AI assistant context. 
   - **Minimum requirement**: Generate 4-5 best practices (not just 2)
   - **How to find**: Search for "Azure [Service Name] best practices" official documentation page
   - **Priority order**: Security first, then reliability, cost optimization, operational excellence, and performance
   - **Required coverage**: At least one practice from each category:
     1. **Security**: ✅ Authentication method (prefer Entra ID over API keys), role assignments, network security, data encryption
        - ❌ AVOID: "Secure your API keys" (outdated - recommend Entra ID instead)
     2. **Reliability**: Redundancy, backup, disaster recovery, health monitoring, geo-replication
     3. **Cost**: Right-sizing, tier selection, query optimization, reserved capacity, monitoring usage
     4. **Performance**: Caching, partitioning, indexing strategies, query patterns, scaling limits
   - **Focus on**: Azure Well-Architected Framework principles adapted for natural language interaction
   - **MCP-specific considerations**:
     - How to phrase commands for destructive operations (confirmation patterns)
     - When to use read-only operations vs. modifications
     - Resource naming conventions for clarity in conversation
     - How to leverage AI assistant context across multiple operations
   - **Avoid generic advice**: ❌ "Use descriptive names", "Test before production", "Optimize strategies" (too obvious, not service-specific)
   - **Be specific**: Each practice should reference actual service features or configurations

## Writing Style (Microsoft Learn Guidelines)
- **Tone**: Professional, clear, action-oriented, and customer-focused
- **Voice**: Use second person ("you can", "ensure you have") to address readers directly
- **Natural language examples**: Conversational yet professional - as if speaking to a colleague
- **Sentence structure validation**:
  - ✅ CORRECT: "This integration allows you to manage data without writing code"
  - ❌ WRONG: "This integration allows you to manage data. without writing code" (period before lowercase word)
  - ✅ CORRECT: "Azure AI Search is a cloud search service"
  - ❌ WRONG: "Search Azure AI Search is a cloud search service" (repeated word at start)
  - No run-on sentences exceeding 35 words
  - Each sentence should have clear subject-verb-object structure
- **Avoid**:
  - Marketing language or promotional content
  - Passive voice (use "create a resource" not "a resource is created")
  - Jargon without explanation
  - Future tense for current capabilities
  - Generic phrases: "for your convenience", "easily manage", "powerful features"
- **Be specific**: Include concrete examples with resource names, regions, SKUs
- **Scenarios**: Focus on real-world business problems and solutions
- **Prerequisites**: List only essential requirements, be precise about versions/access needed
- **Best practices**: Emphasize security, cost optimization, and operational excellence

## Important Notes
- Only generate content for fields prefixed with "genai-"
- **Search for official Azure documentation** for the service before generating content. Use tool descriptions as MCP-specific context, but validate against authoritative sources
- For genai-serviceDocLink, search for and provide the URL to the official Azure service overview or "What is [Service Name]?" page
- For genai-additionalLinks, search for related documentation like quickstarts, tutorials, security best practices
- Use actual Azure RBAC role names found in the service's access control documentation
- Ensure all JSON is valid and properly escaped
- If a service has no AI features, omit genai-aiSpecificScenarios entirely
- Generate 3-5 scenarios minimum; can be more for services with many tools
