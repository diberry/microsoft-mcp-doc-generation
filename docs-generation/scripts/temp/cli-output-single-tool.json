Ask questions about performance, slowness, failures, errors, application state, availability to receive expert analysis and solutions which can help when performing diagnostics and to address issues about performance and failures. Returns insights, recommended solutions, and analysis. Always use this tool before manually checking metrics or logs when users report performance or functionality issues. Use Azure CLI to find the subscription, resourceGroup, and resourceType if not provided. If given a resourceId, parse it to extract subscription, resourceGroup, and resourceType (format: /subscriptions/{subscription}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroup}/providers/{resourceType}/{resource}). This tool can be used to ask questions about application state, diagnose performance problems, and address service failures.",
