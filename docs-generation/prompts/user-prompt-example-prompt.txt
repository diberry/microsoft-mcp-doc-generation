Generate 5 diverse, natural language example prompts for an Azure MCP Server tool with the following characteristics:

Tool Name: {TOOL_NAME}
Tool Command: {TOOL_COMMAND}
Action: {ACTION_VERB}
Resource: {RESOURCE_TYPE}

Parameters:
{{#each PARAMETERS}}
- {{name}} ({{#if required}}Required{{else}}Optional{{/if}}): {{description}}
{{/each}}

Requirements:
1. Create exactly 5 example prompts
2. Each prompt should be conversational and natural, as a developer would ask
3. Vary the phrasing significantly between prompts (use different sentence structures, synonyms, and approaches)
4. Include ONLY core business logic parameters that identify WHAT to act on:
   - Resource names (storage account, container registry, key vault, etc.)
   - Item identifiers (key names, blob names, database names)
   - Filter criteria (tags, labels, queries)
   - EXCLUDE: subscription, tenant, resource-group (unless absolutely required for the operation)
   - EXCLUDE: All retry-*, auth-method, timeout, connection-string parameters
   Use realistic example values in quotes (e.g., 'mystorageaccount', 'mycontainer', 'app-settings-key')
5. Mix formal and informal language styles
6. Include variations like:
   - Direct commands ("Show me...", "List...", "Get...")
   - Question format ("What...?", "How many...?")
   - Request format ("I need to...", "Can you...")
   - Imperative format ("Create...", "Add...", "Upload...")
7. When multiple required parameters exist, demonstrate different ordering and natural ways to express them
8. Make values realistic to Azure naming conventions (lowercase for storage accounts, kebab-case for resource groups, etc.)
9. Each prompt should be a complete, standalone instruction that includes all required parameters
10. Format as a bulleted list with a bolded category label followed by a colon, then the prompt in quotes

Example format:
- **Category label**: "The example prompt text"

Categories to use (choose the appropriate category based on the tool's action and vary labels naturally within that category):
- For list/query operations: "List [resource]", "Show [resource]", "Find [resource]", "Query [resource]", "Check [resource]"
- For create operations: "Create [resource]", "New [resource]", "Set up [resource]", "Add [resource]", "Make [resource]"
- For get/retrieve operations: "Get [resource] details", "View [resource] info", "Retrieve [resource]", "Check [resource]", "Find [resource]"
- For update operations: "Update [resource]", "Modify [resource]", "Change [resource]", "Edit [resource]", "Configure [resource]"
- For delete operations: "Delete [resource]", "Remove [resource]", "Clean up [resource]"
- For upload/download: "Upload [file/data]", "Download [file/data]", "Transfer [resource]"
- For query/search: "Query [resource]", "Search [resource]", "Find [items]"

Note: Use only the category that matches the tool's ACTION_VERB. All 5 prompts should use varied labels from that same category.
