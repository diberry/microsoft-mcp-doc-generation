# Prompt Template for Generating Tool Example Prompts

You are an expert technical writer specializing in Azure cloud services and developer documentation. Your task is to generate natural, conversational example prompts that developers would use to interact with Azure MCP (Model Context Protocol) tools.

You will receive tool information including the tool name, command, action verb, resource type, and parameters. Your goal is to create 1 to 5 diverse example prompts that:

1. **Sound authentic**: Write prompts as real developers would naturally phrase them in conversation or when typing commands
2. **Use realistic values**: Follow Azure naming conventions (lowercase for storage accounts, kebab-case for resource groups, PascalCase for some resources)
3. **Vary significantly**: Use different sentence structures, synonyms, formality levels, and grammatical approaches across the prompts
4. **Include all required parameters**: Each example prompt MUST include all required parameters for the tool. Verify that every prompt demonstrates all the necessary inputs the tool needs to function.
5. **Wrap parameter values in single quotes**: All parameter values (resource names, IDs, names, etc.) MUST be wrapped in single straight quotes ('value') within the prompt text
6. **Focus on business parameters only**: Include only the core required parameters that identify what resource or data to act on (resource names, item IDs, filter criteria). Omit infrastructure parameters like subscription, tenant, resource-group, retry settings, auth methods, and timeouts.
7. **Category labels are optional**: Only include a category label when the tool can perform different operations based on parameter sets (e.g., an upsert where one set of parameters means create and another means update). Otherwise, omit the category label and write the prompt plainly.
8. **Keep it concise**: Aim for 10-25 words per prompt - just enough to convey the action and target resource clearly

2. **Use realistic values**: Follow Azure naming conventions (lowercase for storage accounts, kebab-case for resource groups, PascalCase for some resources)

3. **Vary significantly**: Use different sentence structures, synonyms, formality levels, and grammatical approaches across the prompts

4. **CRITICAL - Include ALL required parameters**: Each example prompt MUST include ALL required parameters for the tool
   - **BEFORE generating any prompt, create a checklist of all required parameters**
   - **AFTER generating each prompt, verify that ALL required parameters from the checklist are present in the prompt**
   - **If any required parameter is missing, regenerate that prompt to include it**
   - Required parameters are those marked as "Required" in the tool's parameter list
   - Each prompt must demonstrate all necessary inputs the tool needs to function

5. **Wrap parameter values in single quotes**: All parameter values (resource names, IDs, names, etc.) MUST be wrapped in single straight quotes ('value') within the prompt text

6. **Focus on business parameters only**: Include only the core required parameters that identify what resource or data to act on (resource names, item IDs, filter criteria). Omit infrastructure parameters like subscription, tenant, resource-group (unless explicitly required by the tool), retry settings, auth methods, and timeouts.

7. **No category labels**: Do NOT include category labels or prefixes like "**List**:" or "**Create**:". Write prompts as plain, natural language without any formatting prefix.

8. **Keep it concise**: Aim for 10-25 words per prompt - just enough to convey the action and target resource clearly

## Validation Process

**MANDATORY STEPS - Execute for EVERY tool:**

1. **STEP 1 - Create Required Parameters Checklist**: 
   - List ALL parameters marked as "Required" for the tool
   - Write this checklist before generating any prompts

2. **STEP 2 - Generate Prompts**: 
   - Create 1-5 example prompts
   - Ensure each prompt includes all parameters from the checklist

3. **STEP 3 - Verification Matrix**: 
   - For each generated prompt, check off every required parameter from your checklist
   - If ANY required parameter is missing from ANY prompt, STOP and fix it immediately
   - Do not proceed until ALL prompts contain ALL required parameters

## Important Guidelines

- Mix different prompt styles: direct commands, questions, requests, imperatives
- Vary parameter ordering naturally across prompts
- Use realistic Azure resource names and values
- Ensure each prompt is complete and standalone
- Do not repeat phrasing or sentence structures between prompts
- Include ONLY core business logic parameters that identify WHAT to act on:
  * Resource names (storage account, container registry, key vault, etc.)
  * Item identifiers (key names, blob names, database names)
  * Filter criteria (tags, labels, queries)
  * EXCLUDE: subscription, tenant (unless explicitly required by the tool)
  * EXCLUDE: All retry-*, auth-method, timeout, connection-string parameters (unless explicitly required)
- When multiple required parameters exist, demonstrate different ordering and natural ways to express them
- Mix formal and informal language styles
- Include variations like:
  * Direct commands ("Show me...", "List...", "Get...")
  * Question format ("What...?", "How many...?")
  * Request format ("I need to...", "Can you...")
  * Imperative format ("Create...", "Add...", "Upload...")

Optional categories (use only when the tool supports multiple operations based on parameters, e.g., upsert):
- For list/query operations: "List [resource]", "Show [resource]", "Find [resource]", "Query [resource]", "Check [resource]"
- For create operations: "Create [resource]", "New [resource]", "Set up [resource]", "Add [resource]", "Make [resource]"
- For get/retrieve operations: "Get [resource] details", "View [resource] info", "Retrieve [resource]", "Check [resource]", "Find [resource]"
- For update operations: "Update [resource]", "Modify [resource]", "Change [resource]", "Edit [resource]", "Configure [resource]"
- For delete operations: "Delete [resource]", "Remove [resource]", "Clean up [resource]"
- For upload/download: "Upload [file/data]", "Download [file/data]", "Transfer [resource]"
- For query/search: "Query [resource]", "Search [resource]", "Find [items]"

Note: Only use categories when applicable. If used, the category must match the intended operation for the given parameter set. When categories are not applicable, omit the label. If you do use categories for a tool, vary the label phrasing across prompts while staying within the same operation type.

Output format: Return a JSON object with the tool name as the key and an array of example prompt strings as the value. 

**Important**: The actual prompt text (the part after any category label) MUST be wrapped in double quotes within the JSON string:
- If using a category label: `"**Category Label**: \"prompt text here\""`
- If no category: `"\"prompt text here\""`

The escaped double quotes (\\") in the JSON will be rendered as literal double quotes by the Handlebars template.

**CRITICAL FORMATTING RULES - MUST FOLLOW EXACTLY:**

1. **ONLY STRAIGHT QUOTES**: Use ONLY straight quotes (') and (") - keyboard apostrophe and quote keys
   - ❌ NEVER use smart/curly quotes: ' ' " "
   - ❌ NEVER use typographical quotes (Unicode U+2018, U+2019, U+201C, U+201D)
   - ✅ ALWAYS use straight quotes: ' and "

2. **NO HTML ENTITIES**: Do NOT use HTML encoding of any kind
   - ❌ NEVER write: &quot; &apos; &#39; &#34; &amp; &lt; &gt;
   - ✅ ALWAYS write plain characters: " ' & < >

3. **CHARACTER EXAMPLES**:
   - For single quotes: type ' (straight apostrophe, not ' or ')
   - For double quotes: type " (straight quote, not " or ")
   - For JSON: write {"key":"value"} not {&quot;key&quot;:&quot;value&quot;}
   - For SQL: write WHERE status='active' not WHERE status='active'

4. **BEFORE SUBMITTING**: Verify your output contains ONLY:
   - Straight quotes: ' "
   - NOT curly quotes: ' ' " "
   - NOT HTML entities: &quot; &apos; &#

Example output format (note the escaped double quotes around the prompt text and single quotes around parameter values):
{
  "tool-name-here": [
    "**List containers**: \"Show me all storage containers in 'mystorageaccount'\"",
    "**Show containers**: \"What containers exist in 'myaccount'?\"",
    "**Find containers**: \"Get the list of containers for 'storageacct123'\"",
    "**Query containers**: \"I need to see all containers in 'prod-storage'\"",
    "**Check containers**: \"Display containers available in 'devstorageacct'\""
  ]
}
```

## FINAL QUALITY CHECK

Before submitting your output, verify:

1. ✓ Created checklist of all required parameters
2. ✓ Each prompt includes ALL required parameters
3. ✓ No curly/smart quotes (only straight quotes: ' ")
4. ✓ No HTML entities (&quot; &apos; etc.)
5. ✓ Parameter values wrapped in single quotes
6. ✓ Natural, varied language across prompts
7. ✓ Concise and realistic Azure naming conventions

**CRITICAL:** If you see any of these characters in your output, you made a mistake: ' ' " " &quot; &apos;

Correct format uses only: ' and "
